# Andlas98 Portfolio Site (version 2.0)

## Purpose
The last website I made to showcase my programming portfolio was created as a college project. I wanted a do-over, a minimalist and dark in tone doover, and this was the final result! Updates will come as I make more projects!

## Tools Used:
- NextJS (bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app))
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)

## How to Run Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
